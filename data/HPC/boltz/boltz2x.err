/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/connectors/logger_connector/logger_connector.py:76: Starting from v1.9.0, `tensorboardX` has been removed as a dependency of the `pytorch_lightning` package, due to potential conflicts with other packages in the ML ecosystem. For this reason, `logger=True` will use `CSVLogger` as the default logger, unless the `tensorboard` or `tensorboardX` packages are found. Please `pip install lightning[extra]` or one of them to enable TensorBoard support by default
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pytorch_lightning/utilities/migration/utils.py:56: The loaded checkpoint was produced with Lightning v2.5.0.post0, which is newer than your current Lightning version: v2.5.0
You are using a CUDA device ('NVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe MIG 7g.80gb') that has Tensor Cores. To properly utilize them, you should set `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium' | 'high')` which will trade-off precision for performance. For more details, read https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.set_float32_matmul_precision.html#torch.set_float32_matmul_precision
