# smiles-fold-input-builder
A repository to prepare input files for modified peptide structure prediction.

Generate an input file for AlphaFold3, Boltz or Chai starting from the SMILES of any peptide generated by pep-edit.
To see examples, simply run ```bash generate_examples.sh```.

The structures generated (and the code used on a HPC) with these inputs can be found in ```data/HPC```.
